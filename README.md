## DEVELOPMENT CLOSED. ðŸ”’
I switched to TickTick, which already has this shortcut feature and the overall app is much more optimised. Thank you.

(Swipe down for more screenshots) A minimalist study timer that stays out of your way while tracking everything that matters. 

## Why StudyTracker?

Most study timers are distracting. They need too many clicks, clutter your screen, and still miss important features. StudyTracker is different - simple/ no extra efforts of manually turning on the timer/ if you're a streamer- no extra effort of going to OBS and starting/stopping the timer each time.

## Features

### Core
- **One-key control** - Start/stop with `Alt + Shift + 1` from anywhere
- **System tray app** - Runs quietly in the background, click to open dashboard
- **Auto-saves everything** - SQLite database preserves all sessions between reboots
- **Sound feedback** - Subtle audio cues when starting/stopping (customizable)

### Analytics
- **Comprehensive stats** - Daily, weekly, monthly breakdowns with averages
- **GitHub-style heatmap** - Visualize your consistency across the year
- **Interactive charts** - Weekly/monthly bar charts with drill-down capability
- **Streak tracking** - Current and longest streaks to keep you motivated

### Rewards System
- **Earn coins** - 1 hour of study = 1 coin
- **Custom rewards** - Set your own rewards at 50, 100, 200 coins or 14-day streak
- **Progress tracking** - Visual progress bars show how close you are to each reward

### Stream Integration
- **OBS overlay** - Real-time HTML display for streamers
- **Live updates** - Shows current session, today's total, and streak
- **Clean design** - Minimal, professional overlay that fits any stream aesthetic

### Quality of Life
- **Manual adjustments** - Add/remove time for any date
- **Log management** - Edit or delete individual sessions
- **Import/Export** - JSON backup and restore
- **Fullscreen mode** - F11 for distraction-free viewing
